# Problem Statement 
One day, you find an interesting puzzle on a magazine, asking to find as many differences between two given images for an astounding prize money. You being lazy, despite the reward, want to find a simple yet robust algorithm which can do the given task with good accuracy. Finally, you go a step ahead and make an LED matrix of suitable size, segment the image into corresponding size and glow the LED's wherever you find a difference with the help of a microcontroller.
